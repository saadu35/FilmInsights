# FilmInsights

### Project Overview
In this project, I aim to analyze a dataset containing information about movies to identify correlations between various variables. The dataset includes details such as budget, gross earnings, ratings, and release years for a variety of movies. By leveraging statistical analysis and visualization techniques, I seek to uncover relationships and patterns within the data.

### Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle and it is a  CSV file named 'movies.csv'. It contains information about different movies, including attributes such as budget, gross earnings, ratings, release dates, and production companies.

### Tools
The analysis is conducted using Python programming language and several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. The key libraries employed in this project include:
- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: for numerical operations
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: for data visualization

### Data Cleaning Tasks

1. Handling Missing Data: The dataset is examined for missing values in each column. Strategies such as imputation or removal of missing data are applied as needed.

2. Data Type Validation: Ensure correct data types for each column, converting them if necessary.

3. Dealing with Duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate entries in the dataset.

### Data Analysis

1. Descriptive Statistics: Explore basic statistics for key variables, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

2. Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers, especially in variables like 'gross.'

3. Correlation Analysis: Explore correlations between numeric variables using correlation matrices and visualizations. Investigate the relationship between variables such as budget, score, and gross earnings.

4. Categorical Variable Analysis: Explore the impact of categorical variables, such as 'rating' and 'company,' on gross earnings.

5. Temporal Analysis: Investigate trends over time by analyzing gross earnings and other variables across different years.

### Results

1. Correlation Findings:
- Identify and discuss significant correlations between variables.
- Highlight any unexpected or interesting patterns observed during the analysis.
  
2. Categorical Variable Impact:
- Discuss how categorical variables, such as movie ratings, influence gross earnings.

3. Temporal Trends:
- Report on any trends or patterns observed over different years.
